# MoreCoOp
A TowerFall mod using the ModFall mod loader, which adds new Co-Op maps to the game. Currently it's just a showcase and none of the levels are fully playable, but I'm working on implementing them all.

# Installation
Drop the (unzipped) MoreCoOp folder into your TowerFall/Mods/ folder after you have installed ModFall (https://github.com/JaThePlayer/Modfall)
