# MoreCoOp
A TowerFall mod using the ModFall mod loader, which adds new Co-Op maps to the game.

Currently has:
* 2 maps
* 1 new enemy

(NOTE: The maps are example maps made by devs, I only port them to the co-op format)

# Installation
Drop the (unzipped) MoreCoOp folder into your TowerFall/Mods/ folder after you have installed ModFall (https://github.com/JaThePlayer/Modfall)
